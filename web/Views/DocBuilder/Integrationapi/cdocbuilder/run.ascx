<p class="dscr">Run <b>ONLYOFFICE Document Builder</b> executable. If you do not want to write a C++ application, you can simply use the docbuilder.exe executable file and run it with the .docbuilder file as an argument, where all the code for the document file creation will be written. For C++ the path to the executable file from the sPath parameter must be used, the CDocBuilder object created and the Run method is called.</p>
